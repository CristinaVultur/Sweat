			<h2>Weight Loss Tips That Are Actually Evidence-Based:</h2>
			<p>The weight loss industry is full of myths. People are often advised to do all sorts of crazy things, most of which have no evidence behind them.	However, over the years, scientists have found a number of strategies that seem to be effective. Here are some weight loss tips that are actually evidence-based.</p>

							<h2>1.Drink Water</h2>
							<img src="img/how-much-water-should-you-drink-per-day-1296x728-feature.jpg" alt="water">
							<p>It is often claimed that drinking water can help with weight loss — and that’s true.</p>
							<p>Drinking water can boost metabolism by 24–30% over a period of 1–1.5 hours, helping you burn off a few more calories</p>
							<p>One study showed that drinking a half-liter (17 ounces) of water about half an hour before meals helped dieters eat fewer calories and lose 44% more weight, compared to those who didn’t drink the water.</p>

							<h2>2.Eat Eggs..or any other protein for breakfast</h2>
							<p>Eating whole eggs can have all sorts of benefits, including helping you lose weight.</p>
							<p>Studies show that replacing a grain-based breakfast with eggs can help you eat fewer calories for the next 36 hours as well as lose more weight and body fat</p>
							<p>If you don’t eat eggs, that's fine. Any source of quality protein for breakfast should do the trick.</p>

						<h2>3.Drink Green Tea</h2>
						<p>Like coffee, green tea also has many benefits, one of them being weight loss.</p>
						<p>Though green tea contains small amounts of caffeine, it is loaded with powerful antioxidants called catechins, which are believed to work synergistically with caffeine to enhance fat burning .</p>
						<p>Although the evidence is mixed, many studies show that green tea (either as a beverage or a green tea extract supplement) can help you lose weight</p>
					
						<h2>4.Cut Back on Added Sugar</h2>
						<p>Added sugar is one of the worst ingredients in the modern diet. Most people consume way too much.</p>
						<p>Studies show that sugar (and high-fructose corn syrup) consumption is strongly associated with an increased risk of obesity, as well as conditions including type 2 diabetes and heart disease </p>
						<p>If you want to lose weight, cut back on added sugar. Just make sure to read labels, because even so-called health foods can be loaded with sugar.</p>
					
						<h2>5.Eat Less Refined Carbs</h2>
						<p>Refined carbohydrates include sugar and grains that have been stripped of their fibrous, nutritious parts. These include white bread and pasta.</p>
						<p>Studies show that refined carbs can spike blood sugar rapidly, leading to hunger, cravings and increased food intake a few hours later. Eating refined carbs is strongly linked to obesity .</p>
						<p>If you're going to eat carbs, make sure to eat them with their natural fiber.</p>
					
						<h2>6.Exercise Portion Control or Count Calories</h2>
						<p>Portion control — simply eating less — or counting calories can be very useful, for obvious reasons</p>
						<p>Some studies show that keeping a food diary or taking pictures of your meals can help you lose weight.</p>
						<p>Anything that increases your awareness of what you are eating is likely to be beneficial.</p>
					
						<h2>7.Keep Healthy Food Around in Case You Get Hungry</h2>
						<p>Keeping healthy food nearby can help prevent you from eating something unhealthy if you become excessively hungry.</p>
						<p>Snacks that are easily portable and simple to prepare include whole fruits, nuts, baby carrots, yogurt and hard-boiled eggs.</p>
					
						<h2>8.Lift Weights</h2>
						<p>One of the worst side effects of dieting is that it tends to cause muscle loss and metabolic slowdown, often referred to as starvation mode.</p>
						<p>The best way to prevent this is to do some sort of resistance exercise such as lifting weights. Studies show that weight lifting can help keep your metabolism high and prevent you from losing precious muscle mass.</p>
						<p>Of course, it's important not just to lose fat — you also want to build muscle. Resistance exercise is critical for a toned body.</p>
